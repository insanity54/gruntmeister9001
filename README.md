Tor was standing outside his run down electronics shop in a forgotten sector of a busy megatropolalus. He breathed in the polluted air, which was somehow a relief from ten minutes ago when he was indoors. It was rainy and dark, and a couple working streetlights cast rays on the wet cracked concrete. Above the lamps, Tor glanced at the defunct monorail which passed overhead. It was covered in moss, something that seemed to happen to everything in the area. There were a couple people walking down the street, one carrying a tattered bag with soiled, thankful smiley faces. No cars here, but their noise was ever present in the distance. Across the street, huddled in newspapers, a shoeless, grey haired homeless man sheltered himself from the rain. Tor pulled out his iCig, which he jailbroke last week, and wondered, "How the hell did that guy find newspapers in this day-and-age?"

New Bork, 3017, the city of dreams. What a joke, more like the city lies. Tor came here looking for a place to set up shop that would actually create revenue. After three months, he was 5^5 cryptos in debt. The realtor was a straight-up scum bag, this area wasn't the creme of the crop he said it was. The Borgle Analytics even showed this place was overflowing with big spending consumers. That asshole paid a cracker to rig the statistics, even went as far to fill the street with fake shops and bots. Tor was duped big time, and now it was too late to relocate. The price here was the only thing left that he could still afford. Even then, it was only a matter of time until he'd have to claim bankruptsy. Tor cursed himself for not being more aware. 

It was obvious why this place was nearly abandoned. The sun never shined, it was masked out by pollution. The rain is a constant, so regular he felt like a fish. It stinks, like a sweaty old shoe. "Ah well", Tor thought. "At least I have my health." With that, he took one last drag from his iCig, threw it in his shirt pocket, and went back inside.

Tor's showroom was small, with a minimal selection of consumer electronic devices arranged in display cases. It was the hot ticket items that were on display. Wearable computers, ranging from good to best. The most popular cyberbrain modules, standard, and regulation grade. Brain-to-brain interface cables, because Tor was oldschool, and openly paranoid about wireless interfaces. Digi-paper, stacked by the ream, for every day use. Tor hated digipaper, you couldn't turn it off or easily block their signals, but it was his best selling item. It was useful too, every wall was layered with it, displaying cyberbrain marketing videos and product demonstrations. 

It was a measly selection compared to the big shops, but that was never the point of the store. Tor's strong point was the service, not the product. There were too many n00bs on the street, getting their cyberbrains cracked every other day, never knowing it even happened. Business was as slow as it could be, but the twenty-three customers that Tor did have, came and left with the tools and knowledge they needed to stay secure.

Tor made sure everything was in it's place, then headed for the back office. In the corner before the door, a rented cyborg snack dispenser. Lately it's only user had been Tor himself. Who knows how many hundreds of Pokey-Stix he had eaten in the last week. Tor started to condemn his bad habit before justifying, "It's not like I can get fat." as he looked down at his flat cyberbelly.

Into the back office. It was a mess, a stark contrast between the showroom in the front. Poorly lit, with almost no walkspace, there were two types of furniture in this office. Workbenches, and server racks. Workbenches with literal piles of equipment, only mere centimeters of desktop exposed. Mini server racks acting as chairs, a real one nowhere to be found. Fusing irons and other hand tools, laid on workbenches in no apparent order, or buried under scrap wire and unsorted connectors. Discarded, half-dissasembled cyborg limbs, limp and crammed into file folder crates. Server racks, lined with water cooled microservlets, chugging away and humming, at some seemingly important task.

Tor's cubicle, if it could be called that, was partitioned by workbenches stacked on workbenches, creating extra storage space, and blocking out what little light there was to begin with. The cube had a glow of it's own, brought on by the power light of dozens of small handhed electronic devices. Custom made by Tor himself, each with just one job that it did well. A flashlight. A motor. A screwdriver. A display. A keyboard. A processor. Alone, each device could do one task, but together, they could do much more. Tor picked up the flashlight, and firmly pressed it against the screwdriver handle. The nanobot housing of the two became a sort of fluid, bonding together where they met. With a little force, the two were pulled apart and restored their original shape. It took a few times to get the flashlight positioned where he wanted it, but suddenly Tor's screwdriver was ready to work in the dark!

Next Tor grabbed the motor, pressing it against the back of the flashlight and the screwdriver. The motor too bonded with the other objects, forming an illuminated screwdriver with a motor. Tor needed something to control the motor, so he grabbed his keyboard, pinching it at each corner, and forcing it into a smaller shape. Intuitively, the nanobots reacted, changing the full qwerty keyboard into a numbepad as Tor compressed the device. Pinching still and scaling smaller, tor kept shrinking the keyboard until it became a simple on/off switch. Satisfied, the switch was added to the screwdriver concoction, and now Tor had an illuminated cordless drill. With it's help, Tor worked lated into the night on his next invention.

Morning came, and Tor opened up his showroom. While running his openShop() routine, Tor looked out the front window at an empty street. The homeless man who squatted across the street was gone, in his place some soaked newspapers. There was an odd break in the rain, and an unusual sunbeam pierced through the smog, sunlight blindingly bouncing off puddles on the road. Eager to get back to work, Tor ran his getFix() subroutine so he could skip the iCig this morning. 

He grabbed a snack from the vending machine before putting his hand on the office door. The sunlight caught his eye again, and he turned to look out the window one more time. "It looks so calm today", Tor thought. "Maybe I should go outside." Tor paused and thought it over, but quickly decided against it. Today, Tor was on a verge of a breakthrough.

On the way over to his cube, Tor inhaled his breakfast. Sitting down quickly, Tor suddenly smiled. "Cyber time", he said with a grin. Tor sat, feet crossed, on top of his mini server rack seat. Closing his eyes, he faded out of the physical world, and his real world came into focus.
